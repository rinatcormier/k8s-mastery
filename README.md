*Another cool article as an appendix to the series about adding Ingress to our architecture:*
- [ ] [Ingress Controller - simplified routing in Kubernetes](http://web.archive.org/web/20230604164824/https://www.orange-networks.com/blogs/210-ingress-controller-simplified-routing-in-kubernetes)

*Also faced an article from the same author about CronJob which creates Postgres backups. It will be useful to try it by myself:*
- [ ] [Back up databases using Kubernetes CronJobs](http://web.archive.org/web/20230604181920/https://www.orange-networks.com/blogs/208-back-up-databases-using-kubernetes-cronjobs)
